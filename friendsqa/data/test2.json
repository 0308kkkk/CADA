Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor ! u3 Fake Monica : So once they caught on to the fact that we 're , y'know , short and have breasts ... u4 Monica Geller : ... They threw us out ! I was thrown out of a hotel ! Me ! u5 Rachel Green : Go Monana ! Well , you ladies are not the only ones living the dream . I get to go pour coffee for people I do n't know . Do n't wait up . u6 Fake Monica : Oh , by the way , tomorrow we 're auditioning for a Broadway show . u7 Monica Geller : ' Scuse me ? u8 Fake Monica : There 's an open call for Cats . I 'm thinking we go down there , sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves . Whaddya say ? u9 Monica Geller : Nononononono . Think who you 're dealing with here . I mean , I 'm not like you . I - I ca n't even stand in front of a tap class . u10 Fake Monica : Well , that 's just probably 'cause of your Amish background . u11 Monica Geller : What ? u12 Fake Monica : Well , you 're Pennsylvania Dutch , right ? u13 Monica Geller : Right . Till I bought a blow dryer , then I was shunned . u14 Fake Monica : I - I used to be just like you . And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life . Did you ever see Dead Poets ' Society ? u15 Monica Geller : Uh-huh . u16 Fake Monica : I thought that movie was so incredibly ... boring . I mean , that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he ca n't be in the play ? What was that ?! It 's like , kid , wait a year , leave home , do some community theatre . I walked out of there and I thought , ' Now , that 's two hours of my life that I 'm never getting back . ' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do . u17 Monica Geller : Wow . Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire ."

My sister 's graduating from college , nobody thought she would . It 's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica . u15 Monica Geller : So what happened ? u16 Rachel Green : My parents happened . All they had to do was sit in the same stadium , smile proudly , and not talk about the divorce . But nooo , they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address . Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them . But you know what , you know what the good news is ? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours . u17 Phoebe Buffay : Ok , so I guess we do n't invite her parents . u18 Monica Geller : Well , how bout just her mom ? u19 Chandler Bing : Why her mom ? u20 Monica Geller : Cause I already invited her . u21 Phoebe Buffay : Ooh , ooh , did you ask Stacy Roth ? u22 Joey Tribbiani : Oh no , ca n't invite her .
